    "The Monty Hall problem is a counter-intuitive statistics puzzle:\n",
    "- There are 3 doors, behind which are two goats and a car.\n",
    "- You pick a door (call it door 1). Youâ€™re hoping for the car of course.\n",
    "- Monty Hall, the game show host, examines the other doors (2 & 3) and opens one with a goat. (If both doors have goats, he picks randomly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually a number of assumptions:\n",
    "- Monty will always open a door.\n",
    "- Monty never opens the door you have chosen.\n",
    "- Monty never opens the door with the car behind it.\n",
    "- The car is equally likely to be behind any door.\n",
    "- Given a choice of doors, Monty chooses at random.\n",

    "# Reason why I wrote this code\n",
    "I have watched videos but I was still confused with why the probability was 2/3.\n",
    "From the videos, I understood the logic and concept of it but not the explanations on youtube as to why it is 2/3. Perhaps it is because the videos did not explain the math behind how 2/3 was attain.\n",
    "\n",
    "After much research of Bayes Theorem, I could understand it but I wanted an easier way.\n",
    "So I decide to code it with 10 million trials to see what the probability tends to."
